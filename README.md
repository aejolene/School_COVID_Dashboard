# School COVID Dashboard

This is a basic COVID-19 positive case tracking dashboard published as a [Shiny](shinyapps.io) application for a school to track student cases. It's built in R with flexdashboard and DT for interactivity. The back end is a Google Sheet set to public view. School officials can easily add new cases to the Google Sheet and changes are reflected in the dashboard.

To modify this dashboard for another school, run this project in RStudio or online without any installation at https://rstudio.cloud/. Host the interactive version for free or low cost at https://www.shinyapps.io/.

Copy this [template for the back-end Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14mekhT7QF3EOhuV3iJHF4qb3LNX8dE8vQI2lvmSFwmA/edit?usp=sharing). Share with appropriate editors and turn on View-Only link sharing to make the sheet public.
