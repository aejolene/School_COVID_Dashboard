# School COVID Dashboard

This is a basic COVID-19 positve case tracking dashboard designed Shiny application for a school to track student cases. It's built with Flexdashboard. The back end is a Google Sheet set to public view. School officials can easily add new cases to the Google Sheet and changes are reflected in the dashboard.
